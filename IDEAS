The game, in sandbox mode starts with the task that you need to define the society of your species,
if your species are droped down on the map they will be called society, since the only civilized entity
groups can be your main species. After that the group you can "Rule" above will all consist of your species
you will have the right to command them to do things, like building, grathering, hunting or fighting, it all
depends on you. But you must be careful, you start the game with some materials you need from the begining
(wood, stone, food, water), you can build your own civilization up from these, but if there is not enough food
or water, your species may be rebelious and will do as their need wishes, what's more, they might migrate to
somewhere else to build a completly new society. Other communites/societies can appear in the game, on the same
map as you, since there can be species whom have the Civilized trait, they can fight with you, trade with you
or just be neutral, it depends on their traits, and yours.
